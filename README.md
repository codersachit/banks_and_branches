Description of the method used to solve the problem:-

I have used python's django framework to solve the problem. In the process of solving the problem, i have installed graphene-django package. Graphene-django lets me add graphql functionality to my project. In the project, there is only one application named fetch_branch_data.In that application, there are two model classes- bank and branch. Branch has a foreign key relation with bank as each branch is associated with a bank. For testing purposes, i have populate my tables using two json files - bank.json for bank table and branch.json for branch table. In schema.py file within the fetch_branch_data app, BankNode class lets me expose the data of Banks, BranchNode class lets me expose the data of Branches and with the query class, graphene.relay.Node.Field allow me to make a query in a single object (in my case bank and branch) by passing an ID as input and DjangoFilterConnectionField within the query class would return list of objects (in my case bank and branch) and also let me apply filters on the fields of these models.
